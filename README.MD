# SafeClient

Safeclient is safecloud's client application and entrypoint for any application that uses safecloud.
This component is based on HBase 0.98 and exposes an Extended HTable API defined in the project hbaseInterfaces. An
extended interface of HTableInterface API was necessary as it doest not define every method available in HTable and DQE
requires some of these methods.
